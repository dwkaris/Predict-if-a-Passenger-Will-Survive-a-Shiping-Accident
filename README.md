# KNeighborsClassifier
## Building a model that correctly predict if a passenger will survive a shiping accident.
## Recording the Experimental Design
## Below is the expected workflow of our Analysis

1.   Data Cleaning and Preparation

*   Load libraries and dataset
*   Deal with mising values
  
2.   Perform EDA

*   Univariate Analysis
*   Bivariate Analysis
*   Multivariate Analysis

3.  Spliting dataset into testing and training data

4.  Perform classification using the Knearest Classifier, using the best hyperparamers.

5. Compute the accuracy (percentage of correct classification).
6.  Repeat step 3 to step 4 twice, each time splitting the datasets differently i.e. 70-30, 60-40, then note the outcomes of your modeling.
7.  Provide further recommendations to improve both classifiers.
